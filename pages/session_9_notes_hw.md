- # Lecture:
	- moduular math over primes and composites!!!
	- lots of finite fields in cryptography!
		- gives an upper bound to numbers we gotta compute
		- and have properties to do inverses and transforms with them!
		- but we still need to do discrete logs which are hard!
	- Discrete logs: factoring priimes!
		- we use the CRT!
- Relay attacks!
	- if underlying cryptography is sound but infrastructure is compromised!
	- at time 0...time 1 deliver message
	- can rearrange messages or tamper
	- so we need to timestamp!
	- end of protocol in internet stack of things is 5-10 years good'
- Forward secrecy! should use ephermeral keys!
	- if alice uses privKey to advesory, that doesn't leak past info or future info
