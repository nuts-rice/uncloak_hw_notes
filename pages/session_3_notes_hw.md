- Chapter 5:
	- Hash Function is a function that takes an arbitarily long string of bits and produces a fixed size result.
	- given a message *m*, we can apply hash function *h* and sign on *h*(*m*) to save on computation
	- result of *h* is typically between 128 to 1024 bits as opposed to millions for the message *m* istself
	- hash functions are sometimes called *message digest* functions and the hash result is called the *digest* or fingerprint

- chapter 5 homework:
	- Exercise 5.3 Consider SHA-512-n, a hash function that first runs SHA-512 and then outputs only the first *n* bits of the result. Write a program that uses a birthday attack to find and output a collision on SHA-512-n, where n is a multiple of 8 between 8 and 48. Your program may use an existing cryptography library. Time how long your program takes when n is 16, averaged over five runs for each *n*. How long would you expect your program to take for SHA-512-256? For SHA-512?
