- 12.2 Chinese Remainder theorem
	- Doing computations modulo a composite number *n*
	- we can do this with Chinese Remainder Theroem
	- numbers modulo *n* are 0, 1...n -1
	- for every pair *x* in *Z_n*, we can compute the pair (*x* mod *p*, *x* mod *q*)
	- Chinese remainder theorem states you can compute inverse function:
		- If we know (*x* mod *p*, *x* mod *q*) we can reconstruct *x*
		- (*a*, *b*) := (*x* mod *p*, *x* mod *q*)
		- gotta make sure theres no *x'* and *x* which result in (a, b)
		- let *d* := *x*-*x'* mod *p* = (*x* mod *p*) - (*x'* mod *p*) = *a* - *a* = 0
		- so *d* is a multiple of *p* and multiple of *q*
		- *d* is a multiple of least common multiple(*p*, *q*)
	- We can also use the *Garner's formula*
	- ``` 
	  x = (((a - b)q^-1 mod p)) mod p) * q + b
	  ```
	- *q^-1* mod *p* term is constant that depends only on *p*  and *q*.
	- we can divide modulo *p* and therefore compuite (1/*q* mod *p*) or (*q*^-1 mod *p*)
	- gives a result *x* that is in the right range and for which (a, b) = (*x* mod *p*, *x* mod *q*)
	- requires one substraction modulo p, one multiplication modulo p, one full multiplication and addition
- 12.4 RSA defined
	- randomly choose 2 different large primes *p* and *q* and compute *n*=*pq*
	- modulus *n* ends up being twice as long as p and q
	- use two different exponents called *e* and *d*, *ed* = 1(mod *t*)
	- where *t*:= leastcommonmultiple(*p* - 1, *q* - 1)

- Chapter 11 + 12
- Diffie hellman: we need a rigirous defn of group is:
- Can Add(), Multiply(), Inverse()
- Cyclic groups give us elements we can do cryptography with, with maximum bit length!
- Every group has an *Identity* and *Closure*
- Prime groups (Intergers modulo a prime too) are upper bounded by bits used to describe them
- Any multiplicative group of modulo prime
- Diffie hellma: sends a group element to power of X, has a known public key to be authenticated by certificate authority.
	- This can then be used to share a secret by exponatie with someone else's private key
	- Discrete log problems come up often in cryptography!
- When we have modulo prime group, we always have p - 1
- Group element to power of order, every element of that will be Identity of that group which is 1, Fermats little theorem
- polynomials also can work as group, with tuple of the coefficents!
	- coefficents are elements of the group
- Man in the middle attacks on diffie hellman?
	- If we dont have way to authenticate an individual, they have to trust certificate authority
	- can claim to be an individual and pretend to be parties exchanging keys
	- certificate authority signs public keys
	- if advesory chooses the generator, then they can narrow the field of possible values for shared secrets, oh no!
	- insecure implementation of generator might not check if group generated is small sub-group (where only value could be the *identity* of group)
- Safe primes
	- Sofie germain primes!
	- No elements should have small order!
	- if a bit size of n, we want at least order of n - 1
	- scaling up by using specific generators to repersent the elements of group
	- Legendre symbol! look it up i guess?
- section 11.8 is good review of this chapter
- chapter 12:
	- TODO I had to go before we covered this in lecture whoops
	- RSA:
		- RSA GTFO paper is worth a read!

- # exercises
- *x* mod 30 = 2, what is obtained about *x* mod 2, *x* mod 3 and *x* mod 5, what about *x* mod 7?
	- using Chinese Remainder theroem that we can obtain  2 is equivlant to *x* mod 2 and 2 is equivalnt to *x*  mod 3
	- so 2 mod 30
	- mod 2, mod 3 and 5
- You're Eve, intercepting a message from Alice to Bob. Alice asked Bob to choose a prime larger than 30 to construct a prime field. You choose *p* = 31, *g* = 2. How many unique choices of exponent *x* in *g^x* equivalnt to *a* mod *p* does Alice now have?  A unique choice is any uniquely obtainable values for *a*. For instance 2^17 is equivlant to 4 mod 31, there for 2^23 which is 4 is not unique
	- so 2 ^ *x* would be equivlant to *a* mod 31, but *x* has to be coprime within that field and does not common divisors
	- so... i guess we should find totient function to find...
	- (2 ^ 30)(30) all divisors p - 1
	-
	- idk check section 11.9 i think
- what if bob had chosen *p* = 83, *g* = 2? how many unique choices of *x* are there now?
- 576001 is prime with factoriztion *p* - 1 = 2^9 * 3^2 * 5^3. Find a generator *g* != 1 with order |g| < 10
	- using fermats test we would have 576001 ^ *p* - 1
		- *x*^57600 - 1 = 0 (mod 576001)
	- for every divisor *d*/57600 , *Z_p* contains *d* elements of order *d*
	- factorized as 2^9 * 3^2 * 5^3 = 0 mod 576001
	- so 576001 - 1 = 9^2 * 2 ^ 3 * 3^5
