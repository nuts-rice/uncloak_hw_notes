	- shamirs shared secret
	- MULTI PARTY COMPUTATION-
	  group of people maintains secret, each party holds onto one share of key to aggrate to one signature'
	- central verifier checks if multiple parties signatures are valid, then outputs final signature
		- but central verifer has to be trusted and needs verify T fro every signatur
	- Threshold signatures
		- need particular shares if we want any t-shares with shares not showing particular information on private keys
		- we can try encoding with error correcting codes (bit padding that show some fraction to reconstruct information about string)
			- each party obtains something that would allow them to reveal whole of t
			- extra storage cost
		- shamirs secret sharing: lets encode secret in a point *x* in some function with higher degrees of freedom (or polynomial)
		- any two distinct points along line will reconstruct lines
		- want T of N (construct degree T polynomial, hand out N points)
		- T-1 (3 out of 4) participants can't brute force in polynomial time
		- give the *n* participants one of t-1
		- Want everyone to contribute randomness toward secret
			- come with private value u_{i} and private coefficents a_{i}
			- private polynomials they construct
		- then they need to share public values , public keys
		- if alice has her polynomial, she can send other players evaluation at index *i* (p_{i}(i)
		- each player has some evaluation of their polynomial coorosponding to their index
		- player(*x*) = b_{0} + b_{1}x + .... b_{t}x
		- BLS signature (aggregation)
			- want: non-interctive signature aggregation
			- want Alice (\sigma_{a},m)
			- bob (\sigma_{b}, m)
			- output final signature
			- we can use pairing signatures!
			- pairing signatures could be plotted as dot products by exponiant *e*
			- using additive notation
